# Questions

Let's keep track of our questions and our conversations about our questions.

If you think you kind of know an answer, but you're not sure, commit it! **Let this be a working document** of our attempts to feel satisfied in our understanding (i.e. learn) :-)

**Leave your (pseudo)name with your answer** so that each answer is **recorded as a dialog.**

Respond to questions and answers with more questions and answers!

You can also **leave a symbol of your intention to research a question** and return later with more words by committing your (pseudo)name below a question that is missing an answer.

**With every answer, include links to resources you used to develop your understanding. If you know something but do not know how you know it, it will still be useful to find and point to a resource that verifies your understanding.**
